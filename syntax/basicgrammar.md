# Basic grammar rules of Bash

![](keywords>bash shell scripting grammar syntax language)

Bash builds its features on top of a few basic **grammar rules**. The
code you see everywhere, the code you use, is based on those rules.
However, **this is a very theoretical view**, but if you're interested,
it may help you understand why things look the way they look.

If you don't know the commands used in the following examples, just
trust the explanation.

## Simple Commands

Bash manual says:

    A simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words and redirections,
    and terminated by a control operator. The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument
    zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.

Sounds harder than it actually is. It is what you do daily. You enter
simple commands with parameters, and the shell executes them.

Every complex Bash operation can be split into simple commands:

    ls
    ls > list.txt
    ls -l
    LC_ALL=C ls

The last one might not be familiar. That one simply adds "`LC_ALL=C`" to
the environment of the `ls` program. It doesn't affect your current
shell. This also works while calling functions, unless Bash runs in
POSIX(r) mode (in which case it affects your current shell).

Every command has an exit code. It's a type of return status. The shell
can catch it and act on it. Exit code range is from 0 to 255, where 0
means success, and the rest mean either something failed, or there is an
issue to report back to the calling program.

\<wrap center round info 90%\> The simple command construct is the
**base** for all higher constructs. Everything you execute, from
pipelines to functions, finally ends up in (many) simple commands.
That's why Bash only has one method to [expand and execute a simple
command](/syntax/grammar/parser_exec.md). \</wrap\>

## Pipelines

FIXME Missing an additional article about pipelines and pipelining

`[time [-p]] [ ! ] command [ | command2 ... ]`

**Don't get confused** about the name "pipeline." It's a grammatic name
for a construct. Such a pipeline isn't necessarily a pair of commands
where stdout/stdin is connected via a real pipe.

Pipelines are one or more [simple
commands](basicgrammar##simple_commands) (separated by the `|` symbol
connects their input and output), for example:

    ls /etc | wc -l

will execute `ls` on `/etc` and **pipe** the output to `wc`, which will
count the lines generated by the ls command. The result is the number of
directory entries in /etc.

The last command in the pipeline will set the exit code for the
pipeline. This exit code can be "inverted" by prefixing an exclamation
mark to the pipeline: An unsuccessful pipeline will exit "successful"
and vice versa. In this example, the commands in the if stanza will be
executed if the pattern "^root:" is **not** found in `/etc/passwd`:
```bash
if ! grep '^root:' /etc/passwd; then
  echo "No root user defined... eh?"
fi
```
Yes, this is also a pipeline (although there is no pipe!), because the
**exclamation mark to invert the exit code** can only be used in a
pipeline. If `grep`'s exit code is 1 (FALSE) (the text was not found),
the leading `!` will "invert" the exit code, and the shell sees (and
acts on) exit code 0 (TRUE) and the `then` part of the `if` stanza is
executed. One could say we checked for "`not grep "^root" /etc/passwd`".

The [set option pipefail](/commands/builtin/set.md#attributes) determines
the behavior of how bash reports the exit code of a pipeline. If it's
set, then the exit code (`$?`) is the last command that exits with non
zero status, if none fail, it's zero. If it's not set, then `$?` always
holds the exit code of the last command (as explained above).

The shell option `lastpipe` will execute the last element in a pipeline
construct in the current shell environment, i.e. not a subshell.

There's also an array `PIPESTATUS[]` that is set after a foreground
pipeline is executed. Each element of `PIPESTATUS[]` reports the exit
code of the respective command in the pipeline. Note: (1) it's only for
foreground pipe and (2) for higher level structure that is built up from
a pipeline. Like list, `PIPESTATUS[]` holds the exit status of the last
pipeline command executed.

Another thing you can do with pipelines is log their execution time.
Note that **`time` is not a command**, it is part of the pipeline
syntax:

    # time updatedb
    real    3m21.288s
    user    0m3.114s
    sys     0m4.744s

## Lists

FIXME Missing an additional article about list operators

A list is a sequence of one or more [pipelines](basicgrammar#pipelines)
separated by one of the operators `;`, `&`, `&&`, or `││`, and
optionally terminated by one of `;`, `&`, or `<newline>`.

=\> It's a group of **pipelines** separated or terminated by **tokens**
that all have **different meanings** for Bash.

Your whole Bash script technically is one big single list!

| Operator                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<PIPELINE1> <newline> <PIPELINE2>` | Newlines completely separate pipelines. The next pipeline is executed without any checks. (You enter a command and press `<RETURN>`!)                                         |
| `<PIPELINE1> ; <PIPELINE2>`         | The semicolon does what `<newline>` does: It separates the pipelines                                                                                                          |
| `<PIPELINE> & <PIPELINE>`           | The pipeline in front of the `&` is executed **asynchronously** ("in the background"). If a pipeline follows this, it is executed immediately after the async pipeline starts |
| `<PIPELINE1> && <PIPELINE2>`        | `<PIPELINE1>` is executed and **only** if its exit code was 0 (TRUE), then `<PIPELINE2>` is executed (AND-List)                                                               |
| `<PIPELINE1> || <PIPELINE2>`        | `<PIPELINE1>` is executed and **only** if its exit code was **not** 0 (FALSE), then `<PIPELINE2>` is executed (OR-List)                                                       |

**Note:** POSIX calls this construct a "compound lists".

## Compound Commands

See also the [list of compound commands](/syntax/ccmd/intro.md).

There are two forms of compound commands:

- form a new syntax element using a list as a "body"
- completly independant syntax elements

Essentially, everything else that's not described in this article.
Compound commands have the following characteristics:

- they **begin** and **end** with a specific keyword or operator (e.g.
  `for ... done`)
- they can be redirected as a whole

See the following table for a short overview (no details - just an

## Shell Function Definitions

FIXME Missing an additional article about shell functions

A shell function definition makes a [compound
command](basicgrammar#compound_commands) available via a new name. When
the function runs, it has its own "private" set of positional parameters
and I/O descriptors. It acts like a script-within-the-script. Simply
stated: **You've created a new command.**

The definition is easy (one of many possibilities):

`<NAME> () <COMPOUND_COMMAND> <REDIRECTIONS>`

which is usually used with the `{...; }` compound command, and thus
looks like:

```bash
print_help() { echo "Sorry, no help available"; }
```

As above, a function definition can have any [compound
command](basicgrammar#compound_commands) as a body. Structures like

```bash
countme() for ((x=1;x<=9;x++)); do echo $x; done
```

are unusual, but perfectly valid, since the for loop construct is a
compound command!

If **redirection** is specified, the redirection is not performed when
the function is defined. It is performed when the function runs:

```bash
# this will NOT perform the redirection (at definition time)
f() { echo ok ; } > file

# NOW the redirection will be performed (during EXECUTION of the function)
f
```

Bash allows three equivalent forms of the function definition:

    NAME ()          <COMPOUND_COMMAND> <REDIRECTIONS>
    function NAME () <COMPOUND_COMMAND> <REDIRECTIONS>
    function NAME    <COMPOUND_COMMAND> <REDIRECTIONS>

The space between `NAME` and `()` is optional, usually you see it
without the space.

I suggest using the first form. It's specified in POSIX and all
Bourne-like shells seem to support it.

<u>**Note:**</u> Before version `2.05-alpha1`, Bash only recognized the
definition using curly braces (`name() { ... }`), other shells allow the
definition using **any** command (not just the compound command set).

To execute a function like a regular shell script you put it together
like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Add shebang

mycmd()
{
  # this $1 belongs to the function!
  find / -iname "$1"
}

# this $1 belongs the script itself!
mycmd "$1" # Execute command immediately after defining function 

exit 0
```

**Just informational(1):**

Internally, for forking, Bash stores function definitions in environment
variables. Variables with the content "*() ....*".

Something similar to the following works without "officially" declaring
a function:

    $ export testfn="() { echo test; }"
    $ bash -c testfn
    test
    $

**Just informational(2):**

It is possible to create function names containing slashes:

```bash
/bin/ls() {
  echo LS FAKE
}
```

The elements of this name aren't subject to a path search.

Weird function names should not be used. Quote from the maintainer:

- * It was a mistake to allow such characters in function names
  (\`unset' doesn't work to unset them without forcing -f, for
  instance). We're stuck with them for backwards compatibility, but I
  don't have to encourage their use. *

## Grammar summary

- a [simple command](basicgrammar#simple_commands) is just a command and
  its arguments
- a [pipeline](basicgrammar#pipelines) is one or more [simple
  command](basicgrammar#simple_commands) probably connected in a pipe
- a [list](basicgrammar#lists) is one or more
  [pipelines](basicgrammar#pipelines) connected by special operators
- a [compound command](basicgrammar#compound_commands) is a
  [list](basicgrammar#lists) or a special command that forms a new
  meta-command
- a [function definition](basicgrammar#shell_function_definitions) makes
  a [compound command](basicgrammar#compound_commands) available under a
  new name, and a separate environment

## Examples for classification

<u>A (very) simple command</u>

```bash
echo "Hello world..."

<u>All of the following are simple commands</u>

```bash

<u>A common compound command</u>

    if [ -d /data/mp3 ]; then
      cp mymusic.mp3 /data/mp3
    fi

- the [compound command](basicgrammar#compound_commands) for the `if`
  clause
- the [list](basicgrammar#lists) that `if` **checks** actually contains
  the [simple command](basicgrammar#simple_commands) `[ -d /data/mp3 ]`
- the [list](basicgrammar#lists) that `if` **executes** contains a
  simple command (`cp mymusic.mp3 /data/mp3`)

Let's invert test command exit code, only one thing changes:

```bash
if ! [ -d /data/mp3 ]; then
  cp mymusic.mp3 /data/mp3
fi
```

- the [list](basicgrammar#lists) that `if` **checks** contains a
  [pipeline](basicgrammar#pipelines) now (because of the `!`)
